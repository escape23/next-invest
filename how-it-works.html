          <h2 class="cryptocurrencie">1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>
          <p class="crypto-text">
            Market cap: $536.8 billion Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto,
            Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most
            cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging
            transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers.
            Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by
            solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work,
            Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters. Bitcoin’s price has
            skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could
            buy one Bitcoin for about $500. As of Oct. 3, 2023, a single
            Bitcoin’s price was around $27,526. That’s a growth of 5,405%.

          <h2 class="cryptocurrencie">2. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
          <p class="crypto-text">
            Market cap: $199.7 billion Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain
            platform, Ethereum is a favorite of program developers because of
            its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that
            automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible
            tokens (NFTs). Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From
            April 2016 to the end of October 2023, its price went from about $11
            to around $1,661, increasing 14,998%.

          <h2 class="cryptocurrencie">3. Tether (USDT)</h2>
          <p class="crypto-text">
            Market cap: $83.4 billion Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency,
            Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat
            currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a
            value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means
            Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other
            cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the
            extreme volatility of other coins.

          <h2 class="cryptocurrencie">4. Binance Coin (BNB)</h2>
          <p class="crypto-text">
            Market cap: $33.0 billion Binance Coin (BNB) is a form of
            cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on Binance,
            one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. Since its launch
            in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades
            on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading,
            payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also
            be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as
            Ethereum or Bitcoin. BNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By late
            October 2023, its price had risen to around $214, a gain of
            214,293%.

          <h2 class="cryptocurrencie">5. XRP (XRP)</h2>
          <p class="crypto-text">
            Market cap: $27.2 billion Created by some of the same founders as
            Ripple, a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can
            be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different
            currency types, including fiat currencies and other major
            cryptocurrencies. At the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was
            $0.006. As of Oct. 3, 2023, its price reached $0.51, equal to a rise
            of 8,398%.
